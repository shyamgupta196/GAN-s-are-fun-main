st.write("Here I present a Generative Adverarial Network, which can generate numbers from noise.\n \n A GAN, is a fight between two networks to win, A Generator and A Discriminator. A generator tries to fool the model by trying to generate images which looks exactly same as original image, whereas a Discriminator tries to calculate the loss, between the image GENERATED image and the ORIGINAL one. Our model WINS only if the Generator succeeds in FOOLING the Discriminator and the loss of discrimator is reduced, which will mean that the discriminator cannot distinguish between an original and a generated image. \n\n Let's understand in brief, how GAN's Work")

The Discriminator is a detective model that takes an imput of original image and compares against the generated image from the generator, basically it stacks a few conv layers
 to extract the information and calculate the losses from it.  We use Leaky ReLU activation function and not use any AF on the last layer.\n\n The Loss function used in network is BCEwithLogitLoss, which makes sense because it applies sigmoid AF automatically while calculating the loss.''')
